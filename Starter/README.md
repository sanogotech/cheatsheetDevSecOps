# What is DevSecOps?

DevSecOps, short for Development, Security, and Operations, is a methodology that integrates security practices within the DevOps process. It emphasizes the importance of incorporating security measures throughout the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC) rather than treating security as a separate or final step. DevSecOps aims to make security a shared responsibility among development, security, and 
operations teams, fostering a culture where security is an integral part of the development process.
